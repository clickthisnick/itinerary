itinerary
===========

<h4>Find yourself always late to the big event?</h4>

That's why I created itinerary.

Itinerary helps you figure out what time you must start preparing for an event<br>
First add the event and the time it starts.<br>
Next add the individual steps you need to take before an event ( Brush Teeth, Travel ) and how much time each step takes.<br>

Now you can see what time you need to start preparing for your event! No more being late!

## TODO

Need to add regex parsing
Need to add some sort of popup toast notifications when things are wrong
Need to make it look nicer
Need to add the time calculations, without an external framework if possible
