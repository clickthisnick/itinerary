itinerary
===========

<h4>Find yourself always late to the big event?</h4>

Thats why I created itinerary.

Itinerary helps you figure out what time you must start preparing for an event<br>
First add the event and the time it starts.<br>
Next add the individual steps you need to take before an event ( Brush Teeth, Travel ) and how much time each step takes.<br>

Now you can see what time you need to start preparing for your event! No more being late!
