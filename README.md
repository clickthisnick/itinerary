itinerary
===========

<h4>Find yourself always late to the big event?<h4>

Thats why I created itinerary.

Itinerary helps you figure out what time you must start preparing for an event<br>
First add the event and its time.<br>
Next add the individual steps you need to take before an event ( Brush Teeth, Travel )<br>

Now you can see what time you need to start preparing for your event! No more being late!
