itinerary
===========

Find yourself always late to the big event?

Thats why I created itinerary.

This will allow you to calculate at what time you must start getting ready for the event.
In the example below I used a Foo Fighters concert as my main event at 3:00 PM.
Then I added what I needed to get done and how much time they take.

Now I know exactly when I need to start preparing for events! No more being late!
